# featurefinder
Workspace for 2.169/6.482 final project

FOR DATABASE: unpack dataset.rar and place in the directory "Machine-feature-dataset-master/dataset/"

Need to install tensorflow to run FeatureNet: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip

TODO:
- implement FeatureNet
  - figure out what is missing from the existing FeatureNet repo (cloned here in "FeatureNet-master" folder)
  - assign different tasks to different people
  - get FeatureNet working on existing dataset

- implement other existing machining feature recognition approaches:
  - (identify other viable, off-the-shelf approaches) 

- develop different feature representation:
  - (figure out viable alternative representation)
  - (implement model with new feature representation)

- compare resulting of different implementations
