- implement FeatureNet
  - figure out what is missing from the existing FeatureNet repo (cloned here in "FeatureNet-master" folder)
  - assign different tasks to different people
  - get FeatureNet working on existing dataset

- implement other existing machining feature recognition approaches:
  - (identify other viable, off-the-shelf approaches)
